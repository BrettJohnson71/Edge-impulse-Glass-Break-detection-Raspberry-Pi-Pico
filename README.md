The PDM folder will need to be copied. You will then need to locate the old PDM folder that arduino IDE created when installing the Raspberry pi pico librarys. This can be done by using an #include <PDM.h> and hovering over it to see where it is located. Then replace the PDM folder with the one I provided.
